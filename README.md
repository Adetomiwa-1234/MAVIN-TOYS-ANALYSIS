# MAVIN-TOYS-ANALYSIS
## Overview
I cleaned and structured the raw dataset by removing duplicates, correcting data types, and standardizing fields. Then, I used Pivot Tables to analyze key metrics like sales by region, product, and month. Calculated fields were added to derive profit margins and performance ratios for deeper business insights.

## Project Objectives:
The main goal of this analysis is to extract actionable insights from Mavin Toys' dataset to support informed decision-making and strategic planning. The specific objectives include:
•	Analyze Sales Patterns
Identify sales trends and seasonality to guide strategies during peak and off-peak periods.
•	Evaluate Product Performance
Assess each product's contribution to sales volume and profitability to highlight top and underperforming items.
•	Measure Store Location Impact
Investigate how store location affects overall sales and profitability, helping identify high- and low-performing outlets.
•	Build a Performance Monitoring Dashboard
Design an interactive, updateable Excel dashboard with key visuals to track ongoing business performance and support continuous data-driven decisions.

## Data Used
- <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vxbZEVYkAMtqcb7Exzv-QDxUza6-b1dd/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=112581567316939365415&rtpof=true&sd=true">Dataset</a>

## Key Questions:
1.	What is the overall trend in sales over time? 
2.	Are there specific days or months when sales peak or decline? 
3.	Which product categories have the highest and lowest sales volume?
4.	Which products are the top sellers in terms of quantity sold?
5.	What is the profit margin for each product category?
6.	How does the location of the store sales performance (Sales and Quantity sold)?
7.	What is the distribution of sales across different cities?
8.	Are there any seasonal trends in the units bought for specific product categories or products?
   

  ## Data Cleaning Process
The dataset contained 14 columns with a mix of numerical and categorical data. I performed the following cleaning steps to prepare the data for analysis:
Removed duplicate rows to ensure accuracy in metrics like revenue and quantity sold.
Corrected inconsistent formats, especially in date columns and category names.
Changed data types where necessary:
Converted currency and price values to Float.
Standardized product names and categories as Strings.
Changed quantities and counts to Whole Numbers for precise aggregation.
This process ensured a clean, reliable foundation for accurate analysis using Excel.


  ## Project Insights
Here are the most valuable insights drawn from the analysis:
1.	Revenue by Month
April had the highest sales volume, indicating a seasonal peak — likely tied to holidays or special campaigns.
2.	Product Category Performance
Toys not only recorded the highest number of sales but also generated the most profit, making it the most valuable product line.
Art & Craft products were also popular in terms of quantity sold, suggesting growing interest in creative items.
3.	Yearly Revenue Trends
The year 2017 outperformed 2018 in terms of total revenue, suggesting either market saturation, pricing issues, or declining demand in the following year.
4.	Location-Based Patterns
Cuidad de Mexico generated the highest revenue across all cities — signaling it as a high-priority location for inventory and promotions.


 ## Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following business actions are recommended:
1.	Double Down on April Strategy
Stakeholders should revisit campaigns, discounts, or inventory strategy that led to April's success, and replicate or scale it across other months.
2.	Leverage Art & Craft Demand
Launch targeted promotions or bundles around Art & Craft products to capitalize on growing interest and convert volume into higher profit.
3.	Prioritize Toy Restocking
Toys drive both volume and profit — ensure all store locations maintain consistent inventory to prevent stockouts.
4.	Focus on High-Performing Locations
Invest more marketing and logistics support in Cuidad de Mexico, and analyze what makes it successful to apply similar models in other cities.
5.	Investigate Revenue Dip in 2018
Perform a deeper dive into why 2018 saw lower revenue than 2017 — consider factors like pricing, store closures, competition, or product availability.


## Conclusion 
This analysis provided a comprehensive view of Mavin Toys' sales and performance trends. It revealed clear seasonal patterns, category performance disparities, and geographic sales strength. By acting on these insights — especially around high-performing months, products, and cities — stakeholders can make data-driven decisions to increase profitability and customer satisfaction.
