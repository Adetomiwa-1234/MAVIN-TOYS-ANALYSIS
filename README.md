# MAVIN-TOYS-ANALYSIS
## Overview
I cleaned and structured the raw dataset by removing duplicates, correcting data types, and standardizing fields. Then, I used Pivot Tables to analyze key metrics like sales by region, product, and month. Calculated fields were added to derive profit margins and performance ratios for deeper business insights.

## Project Objectives:
This project focuses on turning Mavin Toys’ data into clear insights that drive smarter business decisions. The key objectives are to:

Identify sales trends to plan better for peak and off-peak seasons.

Evaluate product performance by highlighting bestsellers and underperformers.

Assess store locations to spot high- and low-performing outlets.

Build an interactive Excel dashboard to track sales and performance in real time.

## Data Used
- <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vxbZEVYkAMtqcb7Exzv-QDxUza6-b1dd/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=112581567316939365415&rtpof=true&sd=true">Dataset</a>

## Key Questions:
1.	What is the overall trend in sales over time? 
2.	Are there specific days or months when sales peak or decline? 
3.	Which product categories have the highest and lowest sales volume?
4.	Which products are the top sellers in terms of quantity sold?
5.	What is the profit margin for each product category?
6.	How does the location of the store sales performance (Sales and Quantity sold)?
7.	What is the distribution of sales across different cities?
8.	Are there any seasonal trends in the units bought for specific product categories or products?
   

  ## Data Cleaning Process
  
The dataset contained 14 columns with both numerical and categorical data. Using Excel, I cleaned the data by:

Removing duplicates for accurate metrics.

Correcting date formats and category names.

Converting prices to floats, product details to strings, and quantities to whole numbers.

These steps provided a clean and reliable foundation for analysis.


  ## Project Insights
Here are the most valuable insights drawn from the analysis:

1.	Revenue by Month

April had the highest sales volume, indicating a seasonal peak — likely tied to holidays or special campaigns.

2.	Product Category Performance
   
Toys not only recorded the highest number of sales but also generated the most profit, making it the most valuable product line.

Art & Craft products were also popular in terms of quantity sold, suggesting growing interest in creative items.

4.	Yearly Revenue Trends

The year 2017 outperformed 2018 in terms of total revenue, suggesting either market saturation, pricing issues, or declining demand in the following year.

6.	Location-Based Patterns
   
Cuidad de Mexico generated the highest revenue across all cities — signaling it as a high-priority location for inventory and promotions.


 ## Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following business actions are recommended:
1.	Double Down on April Strategy
Stakeholders should revisit campaigns, discounts, or inventory strategy that led to April's success, and replicate or scale it across other months.
2.	Leverage Art & Craft Demand
Launch targeted promotions or bundles around Art & Craft products to capitalize on growing interest and convert volume into higher profit.
3.	Prioritize Toy Restocking
Toys drive both volume and profit — ensure all store locations maintain consistent inventory to prevent stockouts.
4.	Focus on High-Performing Locations
Invest more marketing and logistics support in Cuidad de Mexico, and analyze what makes it successful to apply similar models in other cities.


## Conclusion 
This analysis provided a comprehensive view of Mavin Toys' sales and performance trends. It revealed clear seasonal patterns, category performance disparities, and geographic sales strength. By acting on these insights — especially around high-performing months, products, and cities — stakeholders can make data-driven decisions to increase profitability and customer satisfaction.
