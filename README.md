# MAVIN-TOYS-ANALYSIS
## Project Overview
I cleaned and structured the raw dataset by removing duplicates, correcting data types, and standardizing fields. Then, I used Pivot Tables to analyze key metrics like sales by region, product, and month. Calculated fields were added to derive profit margins and performance ratios for deeper business insights.

## Project Objectives:
The main goal of this analysis is to extract actionable insights from Mavin Toys' dataset to support informed decision-making and strategic planning. The specific objectives include:
•	Analyze Sales Patterns
Identify sales trends and seasonality to guide strategies during peak and off-peak periods.
•	Evaluate Product Performance
Assess each product's contribution to sales volume and profitability to highlight top and underperforming items.
•	Measure Store Location Impact
Investigate how store location affects overall sales and profitability, helping identify high- and low-performing outlets.
•	Build a Performance Monitoring Dashboard
Design an interactive, updateable Excel dashboard with key visuals to track ongoing business performance and support continuous data-driven decisions.
